## Description: 
  Dive into a community that seeks to increase their financial independence!
  With a slick dynamic design, increasing personal-finance education could not
  be more engaging. Use our expense tracker and future financial calculators and
  education material to become more finacial literate.
  

## Code Description:
  We used many different technologies to create this expense tracker page for
  others to use. We used canva for the wireframing of the page. To build the
  front end of the page we used HTML, CSS, Javascript and handlebars.js for the
  HTML Templates. To build the back end we used mysql database, express.js,
  sequelize, and many more npm packages below.

## Usage:
  Create an account on the page or sign into the page. Then from there use can
  use the expense tracker and track of your expenses.
